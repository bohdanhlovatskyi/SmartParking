 - star topology: This topology has the advantages of being easy to deploy, and guaranteeing communication and low latency between remote sensor nodes and the base station (44 source: look up)

 - mesh topology: main advantage of this topology is that it maintains connectivity in the network, but its major disadvantage lies in the number of jumps that increase from one communication to another, increasing energy consumption in the network

 -  the sampling frequency is sink-chosen

 - 100
