- Flask server should support two ways of data receiving - threading one with serial and the wifi one with esp
- Esp code is written in the depricated library version, so it would be nice to rewrite
- NODEMCU does not start the nRF module (I guess that the problem is with the wiring)
- finifsh the `/postjson` function -> should fill the general queue that the `/update` then displays
- later on: do the mesh system (relay node that collects the data from 5 nodes via meshnetwork library into allocated buffer and sends it to te gateway (nodemcu that will post it as json (sketch already contains the exaple of json arrays sending)))
